    description: 'The best Rabri is said to be be found only where the source of milk is pure and unadulterated. With all the cattle in the holy cities of that era, it was easy enough to procure the basic ingredients for this dessert straight from the source. The sweetened milk was boiled in a kadai - a deep bowled wok - until it condensed and thickened, and was then garnished with nuts, cardamom and sometimes saffron.Since then, the popularity of Rabri has been adapted and popularized all over the South Asian region and beyond.While rabri is often enjoyed with Malpura, these days it can be found in many different forms, such as Falooda or even kulfi. It is said that rabri was first invented in India’s historic city of Mathura and then finessed and refined in the city of Varanasi.',

    description: 'This favourite sweet, also known as Indian cheesecake, has a faint cheese scent and shares a close appearance. However, while it may resemble cheese or have a faint odour similar to cheesecake, it does not taste like it. Besan barfi is another popular type of this sweet. As the name suggests, it is prepared with besan or chickpea flour. The pistachio nut is added to the Pista barfi. Edges are frequently rolled in groundnut, and whole pieces of nut can be added. Similarly, cashews are used in the preparation of kaju barfi.  To add to its luxury, a layer of edible silver leaf known as vark is often coated on the top.',

    description: 'Laddus are usually made from semolina, gram flour, ghee, sugar, milk, cardamom powder, chopped almonds and pistachios, and varakh to tie it all together. Other flours are sometimes used too. They are usually eaten on their own and you will find yourself unable to eat more than two or three due to their thick sweet and dense texture. There are a few varieties of this sweet such as Motichoor Laddu, Boondi Laddu and Atta Laddu. Of course our laddus are light and one of our best sellers. If consumed on the same day, store in a cool place. If consuming later, then refrigerate for storage but consume only at room temperature.',

    description: 'The word Jalebi is derived from the Arabic word zulabiya. This sweet is said to have been brought to Medieval India as a part of the Muslim trade by the Persian-speaking invaders, much like a lot of other Indian food. In fact, a great deal has been written about Turkish, Persian, Arabic and Central Asian influences on Indian food and the Jalebi too is one such Indian dish that boasts of these influences. One of the earliest mentions of this delicacy dates back to 1450 AD in a Jain work by the name Jinasura. This work has been cited in cookery books of the following centuries as well.Another noteworthy mention of the Jalebi is in a Sanskrit work titled Gunyagunabodhini, written in 1600 AD. This work elaborates the ingredients and the recipe of the modern Jalebi that we’re all familiar with today. A seminal work by Indologist P.K. Gode in the year 1943 revealed these historical references.',

Sugar solution is boiled down until a single thread forms when two fingers are dipped into it and pulled apart, after which it is added to the ground cashews. Ghee, saffron (kesar), and dried fruits may also be added. The paste is then spread and flattened in a shallow, flat-bottomed dish and cut into bite-sized rhombus-shaped pieces. The pieces are usually decorated with edible silver foil. The finished sweet is usually white or yellow in color depending on the ingredients used for the paste and the proportions of each used. Kaju Katli is traditionally eaten during the Hindu festival of Diwali.",

    description: 'Mysore pak was first prepared in the kitchens of the Mysore Palace during the regime of Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, by a palace cook named Kakasura Madappa.Madappa made a concoction of gram flour, ghee and sugar. When asked its name, Madappa had nothing in mind, simply called it the Mysuru paka. Pak (or paka, more precisely) in Kannada means ‘sweet’. It is traditionally served in weddings and other festivals of southern India, and is very popular in baby showers as well.Paaka shastra (short paka) in Kannada means ‘cooking procedure’ or ‘cooking techniques’. Also paka in Kannada refers to sticky sugar syrup obtained by simmering sugar with equal amount of water; specifically for Mysore pak, the simple syrup is heated to the soft ball stage. The syrup is used as the primary sweetening agent in various Indian sweet dishes like Jalebi, Badam puri, Mysore pak and others. The syrup is flavored with various spice essences like cardamom, rose, honey etc. Paka syrup preparation is a skilled art mastered by few cooks, some of whom keep their methods secret.',

    description: 'According to historians of Odisha, the rasgulla originated in Puri, as khira mohana, which later evolved into the Pahala rasgulla. It has been traditionally offered as bhog to goddess Lakshmi at Jagannath Temple, Puri. According to the local legend, Lakshmi gets upset because her husband Lord Jagannath goes on a 9-day sojourn (the ratha yatra) without her consent. So, she locks Jai Vijay Dwar, one of the temple gates and prevents his convoy from re-entering the Garbhagṛha (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple. To appease her, Jagannath offers her rasgullas. This ritual, known as Bachanika, is part of the "Niladri Bije" (or "Arrival of the God") observance, which marks the return of the deities to the temple after the Ratha Yatra.',
